## Analysis
I propose the following revisions to Rpr-Chakraborty-2021:
1. Adjusting the cloropleth map of race model weights to use the full color scale. 
This will improve map legibility. Currently, all of the orange areas appear to have 'high' weights.

2. Fix the formatting of the Missing Data Table such that it fits fully on the screen.
This will improve table legibility.

3. Reformat the discission, including moving the section on paper rationatle, integrating 'Emily's Discussion' with the rest of the paper, and adding a brief conclusion. This will make the paper more conscise and bring its results, both in terms of reproducing the orginal study and new results genereted from making intentional deviations from it, into greater focus.

4. Comparing the county selection of the Kulldorf clustering and the assignment of weight in the GEE model to see if the two methods are largely picking up the same signals, or have slight nuances.

*** note to self : results/discussion and or change organization, definitely do another proofread
## Results
1. The new map will have areas of low weight depicted in light orange and areas of high weight depicted in a darker shade.
2. The table will render in the same format as the other tables in the paper. 
3. The discussion section will be better organized and more easily understood.
4. I will compare the counties included in the Kulldorf clusters produced by SaTScan and SpatialEpi with the counties identified in the GEE model as having low correlations with other counties in their state (and thus high weights)


## Discussion
1. If the new map of model weights shows mostly light hues, it will mean that most counties are correlated with other counties in their states. Accordingly, their influence in the GEE model is adjusted by their weight. Counties that stand out in dark orange are thus those that are *not* correlated with many other counties in their same state, which could make them interesting candidates for study.

2. The newly rendered table will not include any new results, but the results will be easier to read.

3. The new discussion, and in particular, the added conclusion, will comment on the success of the reproduction study and the applicability of the original study given the results of the reproduction.

4. If the counties included in the Kulldorf clusters overlap with the counties assigned high weights in the GEE model, it would support the conclusion that these areas have unusally high COVID-19 risk. However, if the clusters are not the same, or if they differ slightly, it would open up avneues for further exploration between the two methods.
