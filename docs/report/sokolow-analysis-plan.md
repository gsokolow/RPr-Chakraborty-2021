## Analysis
I propose the following revisions to Rpr-Chakraborty-2021:
1. Adjusting the cloropleth map of race model weights to use the full color scale. 
*Rationale:* This will improve map legibility. Currently, all of the orange areas appear to have 'high' weights.
*Visualization:* The new map will have areas of low weight depicted in light orange and areas of high weight depicted in a darker shade.

2. Fix the formatting of the Missing Data Table such that it fits fully on the screen.
*Rationale:* This will improve table legibility.
*Visualization:* The table will render in the same format as the other tables in the paper. 

3. Reformat the the rationale for updated report.
*Rationale:* This will improve the flow of the paper such that when they finish readsing the paper, readers can get a highlight of what has changed and why these improvements are in fact, improvements. 
4. Integrate 'Emily's Discussion' into the general discussion of the paper.
*Rationale:* Right now, the primary discussion is organized by topic, guiding readers through the potential biases of the study and the unplanned deviations embarked upon by the researchers. Emily's discussion then goes back and takes a more chronological approach, summarizing the results and the divergences made from the original study. Combining these two sections will make the discussion more conscise and more legible.
5. Add a conclusion section to sum up whether the reproduction study was successful and what that means for the contribution of the original study to scientific knowledge.
*Rationale:* The 'results' of a reproduction study are not limited to the reproduced (or in this case, slightly altered) results that answer the research question, but also the viability of these results themselves. Thus, writing a short conclusion to address what this reproduction study has found regarding how the results of the original study should be interpreted is important to communicating the results of the replication.

6. Mapping the clusters used in the GEE of the original study. 
*Rationale:* Because 'cluster' is used to refer both to the groups of counties identified by the kulldorf method to have higher levels of relative covid risk than their neighbors AND the groups of counties with any given state that have the same relative risk, it would be helpful to visualize which cluster definition generated by the GEE model and how it relates to the clusters generated by the kulldorf model. 
*Visualization:* I will visualize the relationship between the Kulldorf clusters and the GEE clusters by zooming in on the southwestern united states, where there are examples of both different risk levels within a state (CA) and kulldorf clusters that cross state lines (CA, NV, AZ). Using gee cluster ids, I will map the different clusters in this region (differentiated by hue) to give a visual impression of what the clusters generated by the GEE model look like and how they are related to the kulldorf clusters.

*** note to self : results/discussion and or change organization, definitely do another proofread
